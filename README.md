#My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This project serves as a platform to showcase my skills and knowledge in web development, particularly in the areas of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various CSS and JavaScript libraries.

#Key Features

HTML: The foundation of this website is built on HTML, ensuring a structured and semantic layout for accessibility and search engine optimization.

CSS: I have leveraged my expertise in CSS to create visually appealing and responsive designs. Custom CSS styles have been carefully applied to enhance the user experience.

JavaScript: To add interactivity and dynamic elements, I've used JavaScript to create features such as interactive forms, smooth scrolling, and animated transitions.
