#My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This project serves as a platform to showcase my skills and knowledge in web development, particularly in the areas of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various CSS and JavaScript libraries.

#About the Project

This website is a labor of love, crafted to not only display my abilities but also to share my passion for web development and technology. It reflects my journey of learning and experimenting with web technologies and design principles.

#Key Features

HTML: The foundation of this website is built on HTML, ensuring a structured and semantic layout for accessibility and search engine optimization.

CSS: I have leveraged my expertise in CSS to create visually appealing and responsive designs. Custom CSS styles have been carefully applied to enhance the user experience.

JavaScript: To add interactivity and dynamic elements, I've used JavaScript to create features such as interactive forms, smooth scrolling, and animated transitions.
